JUNIPER EXAMPLE
===============

The first step in running this example is to fetch the juniper XML schema from
your juniper device, use it to generate a yang file and then generate Java
classes from that yang file using the JNC pyang plugin.

This is most easily done using the setup target in the ant-script build.xml,
but before doing this you should make sure that get-schema.sh contains the
proper host name, user name and password. You may also be forced to edit the
generated junos-system.yang to change the module name from junos to
junos-system. If so, run the generate target (not setup) after the change has
been performed.

Summary:
* Edit get-schema.sh to fit your needs
$ ant junos.yang
* Edit module name in junos-system.yang
$ ant generate

Now look at the Client.java file located in src/app. You should make changes to
the hard coded String fields in this class to reflect the host name and login
credentials used in get-schema.sh. You may also modify the local modifications
made to the configuration tree that is made in the main method.

To run your client code:

$ ant compile Client

to successfully perform an edit-config on your juniper router using the model
aware JNC library!
