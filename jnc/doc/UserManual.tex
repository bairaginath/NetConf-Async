This User Guide describes the JNC configuration management library. It provides
an overview of the architecture of the library, its APIs including usage
examples, and guidelines on how to extend the feature set.

JNC also comes with a detailed API specification in Javadoc format.

This guide is designed for developers who are planning to use the library. To
use this document, you will need a broad understanding of the Java programming
language, XML, YANG, and the NETCONF protocol.

The examples in this guide requires access to a standards based NETCONF server.
If we communicate with a NETCONF server with YANG support, we can utilize the
data model at the server and compile a set of Java classes explicitly for the
data model at the managed device, otherwise we must revert to a lower lever API
that is not aware of the data model at the managed device.
