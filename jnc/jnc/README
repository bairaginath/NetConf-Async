The Java NETCONF Client (JNC) library can be compiled using the provided ant-
script in a shell, or by using eclipse. There are of course other options as
well but those are not covered here.

To compile using eclipse, start a new Java project. In the wizard, uncheck the
"Use default location" checkbox and enter this directory as Location. Now just
give the project a name, click Finish and the project should be configured for
you. You will notice that there are compilation errors because the ganymed SSH
Jar-file is missing. Add it to the project build path from the lib directory.

To compile using the provided ant-script in a shell type

$ ant jar

and the Java classes should be compiled, resulting in build folder
containing the class files (main and test) and a jar folder with JNC.jar. Include this Jar-file
when compiling your client code to use the library. If you omit the "all"
argument, the classes will still be compiled but no jar-file will be generated.
